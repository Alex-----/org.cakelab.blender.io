<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://blender.org">Blender's</a> core is written in C and 
blender files are basically dumps of native memory content (C structs and scalar types) 
from heap to a file on disk. A <code>.blend</code> file is organised in blocks 
of arbitrary length, and the type of data is described in a special block, which 
contains type information (meta data) for all C native and 
structured types which can exist in a <code>.blend</code> file.
</p>
<p>
Based on the meta data of any blender file, it is possible to 
generate code for a different language, which is capable to read/write 
data in blender files of the same version. Java .Blend 
is a combination of a code generator and a runtime data I/O module. 
Together, they provides a generic any-version Blender file import/export 
in Java which features all aspects of the Blender DNA data model: The 
code generator is used at development time to generate Java facade 
classes which provide a type-safe API to Blender data and the I/O 
module transparently supports in data access at runtime. 
</p>
<p>
This toolkit was designed with the ambitious goal to serve for any kind of data exchange 
with Blender. Whether just importing data into another graphics engine, conversion to 
a different data format or external processing of data to add features to blender. 
The fully generic mapping of the entire Blender DNA core data model combined with 
both import <b>and</b> export supports all of it.
</p>
<p>
Working with Blender files requires knowledge about its data model. Java .Blends
documentation provides just a high level overview of the data model and the Javadoc 
documentation incorporated in the generated facade classes is still incomplete.
Therefore, the Javadoc source code documentation on generated classes is kept 
in a <a href="https://github.com/homacs/JavaBlendDocs.git">separate repository 
on github</a> and everybody is encouraged to contribute to it.
</p>
<p> 
As a side effect of the generic approach Java .Blend has low maintenance effort 
on maintainers side. New details in blender's DNA will be instantly 
reflected in the generated data model and implicitly supported during import and export.
Thus, users don't have to worry about how long they can rely on this library, they can just 
generate new models by themselves without touching the sources.

<h3>Pregenerated Data Models</h3>
<p>
These packages contain pregenerated data models including the utilities package and
the data I/O submodule. The version numbers provided in the table are Blender's version and minimum version 
the library is compatible with (refer to the Section <a href="spec.html#FileVersion">"Blender Versioning and File Version"</a> in the <a href="spec.html">documentation</a>).
</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Binaries here are under Apache License v2.0. Source code packages contain source 
code documentation of Java .Blend's externally maintained documentation. Thus, the 
source code packages are under GPLv3 (see <a href="#Licensing">Licensing</a>).
</p>
<p>
If you need support for a different Blender version or do not want the dependency on GPL then refer to Section <a href="spec.html#GeneratingCode">Generating Data Model and Utilities</a> in the <a href="spec.html">documentation</a>.

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
This package contains various examples for use cases of Java .Blend. Part of this package is a pregenerated Java .Blend data model for Blender v2.69. It uses <a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/">LWJGL</a> and requires
a graphics card which supports <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL 4.3</a> (for no particular reason, but you should look at the source code anyway!).

<h3>Java .Blend SDK</h3>

<h3>Java .Blend's Externally Maintained Documentation</h3>

<h2 id="Licensing">Licensing</h2>
<h3>Java .Blend SDK</h3>
<p>
Java .Blend SDK and pregenerated code is published under the terms of 
the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt">Apache License V2.0</a>. 
</p>
<h3>Java .Blend's Externally Maintained Documentation</h3>
<p>
<a href="">Java .Blend's Externally Maintained Documentation</a> is licensed under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt">GPLv3</a>.
</p>
<p>
The reason for the different licensing is, that parts of the documentation are copied
from Blender source code and Blender is published under GPLv2. Thus, the documentation is
derived work and has to respect the terms of Blender's license.
</p>
<h3>Effect of the Different Licenses</h3>
<p>
The different licenses mainly affect redistribution of work based on
the documentation files. This means, if someone redistributes work 
which includes the original or modified documentation files or 
source code which contains parts of the documentation files 
(such as comments in generated facade classes), than this work has 
to respect the terms of the GPLv3.
</p>
<p>
Thus, if you consider redistributing derived work under a different 
license compatible with the Apache license of the SDK, than you just 
need to generate facade classes without Javadoc comments. Refer to 
Section <a href="spec.html#GeneratingCode">Generating Data Model and 
Utilities</a> in Java .Blend's documentation in order to learn how 
to do this.
</p>
<p>
If there are still licensing issues that can't be handled that way, 
than feel free to contact me and I'll try to help find a solution - even if I really hate this topic!</p>
