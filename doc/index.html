<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Blender core is developed in C and blender files 
are basically dumps of the native memory content (C-structs and scalar types) 
from heap to disk. The file is organised in blocks of arbitrary length, and 
the type of data in it is described in a special block, which 
contains type information (meta data) for all C native and 
structured types which can exist in a <code>.blend</code> file.
</p>
<p>
Based on the meta data of any blender file, it is possible to 
generate code for a different language, which is capable to read/write 
the data in blender files of the same version. Java Blend 
is a combination of a code generator and a runtime Blender data access module 
which provides generation of Java classes at development time and 
random access to Blender data at runtime. Together, it provides a generic 
any-version blender file import/export in Java. 
</p>
<h2>Concept</h2>
This section gives a brief overview of the general concept behind Java Blend. 
For further details refer to the <a href="spec.html">system specification</a> (not finished yet).
<h3>Modules</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="images/model-generator.png"/></p>
<p>
Java Blend basically consists of two modules:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Model Generator</dt> 
<dd>The model generator (see image above) is a code generator, 
which generates Java code according to the meta data found in a 
reference Blender file. The generated code comprises a data model 
which reflects the data model used in Blender core. This generated 
data model consists of facets with methods to access native data 
in heap memory at runtime.
</dd>
<dt>Runtime Data I/O</dt> 
<dd>Random access to native data of a 
Blender file is provided by the data I/O sub-module (see image below) which is 
working behind the scenes at runtime. It is responsible to transfer data between file and heap memory and
supports facets of the data model in address translation, type 
conversion and data access in general. 
</dd>
</dl>


<p align="center"><img src="images/facet.png"/></p>

To summarise: Based on the type information of any reference blender 
file, the model generator generates a data model in 
terms of facets which provide type-safe access to native Blender data. 
The generated data model in combination with the runtime data I/O module 
is used at runtime to access data of any Blender file of the same version.
Native Blender data is kept in its format in heap memory and accessed through 
the facets getter and setter methods. Life cycle of native data is implicitly 
covered by the Java VMs garbage collection. 

<h3>Method</h3>
<p>
At development time, the model generator is used to generate a 
data model for a particular Blender version, based on any 
<code>.blend</code> file created by Blender. The Java classes
of the data model can be generated into a
source folder of a specific project or compiled and archived in 
a separate Java library (<code>.jar</code>), to be used in 
multiple projects.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example</b>
</p>
<pre>
	java -jar javablend.jar "../myproject/src" "my.package.blender.data" "cube.blend"
</pre>
<p>
Once the data model is available, it can be used in combination with the 
runtime data I/O module to access any <code>.blend</code> file of the
same Blender version. The application opens a Blender file and retrieves
a <code>Main</code> library. In Blender terminology a 'Library' 
represents a file (even external non-blender files). A main library 
provides access to all persistent data in a Blender instance that will be 
stored in a .blend file (all 3D elements, UI and rendering configurations
etc.). The example below shows a use case, where an application opens a 
blender file and retrieves the polygons of a mesh.
</p>
<p>
<b>Example</b>
</p>
<pre>
	//
	// Open file and retrieve main lib
	//
	BlendFile f = new BlendFile("cube.blend");
	Main main = new Main(f);
	f.close();
	
	//
	// retrieve the first mesh's polygons
	//
	Mesh mesh = lib.getMesh();
	MPoly[] polygons = mesh.getMpoly().toArray(mesh.getTotpoly());
</pre>

<em>A full example which demonstrates retrieval of the data for a 
textured cube can be found in the download section below.</em>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
This is a first tech. demo which demonstrates the data read part based on a generated 
data model. It consists of
</p>
<ul>
<li>the <b><a href="downloads/JavaBlend-src-0.0.1.zip">source code</a></b> of model generator and data I/O and</li>
<li>a use case <b><a href="downloads/JavaBlendDemo-src-0.0.1.zip">example with generated data model</a></b> for blender v2.69 
demonstrating how to read and display a textured cube modelled in blender, and</li>
<li>a <b><a href="downloads/JavaBlendDemo-0.0.1.zip">binary of 
the example</a></b> to show that (horribly) textured cube in action. It uses <a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/">LWJGL</a> and requires
a graphics card which supports <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL 4.3</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note: The <a href="spec.html">documentation</a> is not finished (see roadmap).</em>
