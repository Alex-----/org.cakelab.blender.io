<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://blender.org">Blender's</a> core is written in C and 
blender files are basically dumps of native memory content (C structs and scalar types) 
from heap to a file on disk. A <code>.blend</code> file is organised in blocks 
of arbitrary length, and the type of data is described in a special block, which 
contains type information (meta data) for all C native and 
structured types which can exist in a <code>.blend</code> file.
</p>
<p>
Based on the meta data of any blender file, it is possible to 
generate code for a different language, which is capable to read/write 
data in blender files of the same version. Java .Blend 
is a combination of a code generator and a runtime data I/O module. 
Together, they provides a generic any-version Blender file import/export 
in Java which features all aspects of the Blender DNA data model: The 
code generator is used at development time to generate Java facade 
classes which provide a type-safe API to Blender data and the I/O 
module supports in data access at runtime. 
</p>
<p>
This toolkit was designed with the ambitious goal to serve for any kind of data exchange 
with Blender. Whether just importing data into another graphics engine, conversion to 
a different data format or external processing of data to add features to blender. 
The fully generic mapping of the entire Blender DNA core data model combined with 
both import <b>and</b> export supports all of it.
</p>
<p> 
As a side effect of the generic approach Java .Blend has low maintenance effort 
on maintainers side. New details in blender's DNA will be instantly 
reflected in the generated data model and implicitly supported during import and export.
Thus, users don't have to worry about how long they can rely on this library, they can even 
generate new models by themselves without touching the sources.

<p>
This is the second tech. demo now comprising all core features of Java .Blend, such as import/export, 
dealing with facades of a generated data model as well as pointers and arrays. 
It consists of
</p>
<ul>
<li>the <b><a href="downloads/JavaBlend-src-0.0.2.zip">source code</a></b> of model generator and data I/O and</li>
<li>a use case <b><a href="downloads/JavaBlendDemo-src-0.0.2.zip">example with generated data model</a></b> for blender v2.69 
demonstrating how to read and display a textured mesh, modelled in blender, and</li>
<li>a <b><a href="downloads/JavaBlendDemo-0.0.2.zip">binary of 
the example</a></b> to show that (horribly) textured model in action. It uses <a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/">LWJGL</a> and requires
a graphics card which supports <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL 4.3</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note: The <a href="spec.html">documentation</a> is not finished (see roadmap).</em>
